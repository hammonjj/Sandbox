LoL Champion Manager
==========

### Introduction:
Thanks for downloading LoL Champion Manager.  This mod allows you to change the search tag strings that are associated with various champions and change the current ones.  For example, I've created top, mid, and ban categories for easy searching, but I'm sure others will can think of much more creative categories than I have!

### Known Issues/To-Do List:

A few caveats, as this is still in late alpha/early beta:
1) LoL must be installed in the default location (C:\Riot Games)

2) When adding a category, you will see **category if you click on the Champions tab in the UI.  Fear not!  This is purely cosmetic and won't do anything adverse to your client.

3) Some champions have funny names in the code and I haven't had to opportunity to correct it in the mod UI.  For example, Wukong's name in the Riot code base is "MonkeyKing", so that is his current name in the mod.

4) If you place this application in your Program Files, make sure to run it as Administrator so it can actually write to its own directory.

5) I'm sorry, but I've only had time to release x64 binaries.  I will be getting to a x32 version soon.  Additionally, I will be porting this utility over to OS X as well.

### Closing:
Enjoy the mod!  This is something that has always driven me nuts, so I'm excited to bring a solution to the LoL community!  Please direct any issues or improvement requests to champion.manager@pingdynamic.com
